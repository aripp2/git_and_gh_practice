I have always enjoyed making things. From cooking and baking to sewing and personalized cards.
When I can, I will almost always choose to get outside and explore. Camping may be my favorite activity, but that goes hand in hand with my love of photography.
I have had cameras as long as I can remember and hate to miss a good photo op!
