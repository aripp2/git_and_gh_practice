One of the best vacations I have ever had was last summer. We did a 2 week road trip, looping from Colorado to the Pacific Coast and back.
This journey took us through 8 states, some of them multiple times:
Colorado
Utah
Wyoming
Idaho
Washington
Oregon
California
Nevada
Driving down the Oregon Coast on the 101, was wonderful. I will have to say that my favorite place though is Flaming Gorge in Utah.
We had an awesome campsite, beautiful views, and and incredible time cliff jumping into the reservoir's blue water.
